# PDF-differences

### I used python difflib library to differentiate between two pdfs. For this purpose, I just made two pdf files. 
### First, I read pdf files then I extracted those in text files.
### I used regex to clean the text. Difference file is created and saved as an url. 
### For reference, images are given at the last to see the difference as different colors define different meaning.
